# BU-CS520-Final-Project-2025

In my first semester at Boston University, I took the class CS 520 called Information Structures with Java. I chose to take this course over Information Structures with Python 
because over my studies at the University of Northern Iowa, I accumulated a lot of experience in python but not nealry as much in Java. I felt proficiency in both to be pertinient to my career
as a software engineer, so I chose to take this course to develop my programming skills further. Upon completing this course, I can confidently say I am proficient and experienced in the language 
of Java. 

The final project in this class asked us to design and implement a data structure that simulates an automated warehouse. We stored products in up to 100 totes, with each tote holding up to 10 items 
of the same UPC, loaded product data from a file, processed customer orders, retrieved items from the warehouse, and implemented a merge process to consolidate partially filled totes. 
We also documented our design choices, data storage approach, and performance considerations in a short project summary.
All course project matterials can be found in this repository.
